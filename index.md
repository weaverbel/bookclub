**Off-piste - some other ideas for 2019 reading:**

- *The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power* by Shoshana Zuboff. Just read a great review of this in last week's *SMH* Good Weekend section.
- *Daphne du Maurier and her Sisters* by Jane Dunn. This was a *cracker*!
- *Done: The Secret Deals that are Changing Our World* by Jacques Peretti. Eye-opening!
- *Thomas Cromwell: A Life* by Diarmaid MacCulloch. New bio - very detailed - maybe too much so for some.
